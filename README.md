# Self-driving-Mario-Kart-AI

• We develop a self-driving Mario Kart AI with drifting and using items and won Idol Award.<br/>
• The self-driving Mario Kart AI consist of two parts: the driving AI of steering and drifting control and the
item-using AI.<br/>
• The Mario driving AI is trained by a sequential autopilot CNN model and the train dataset is generated by
a Search AI instead of imitation learning. The item-using AI includes 3 parts: item detection by Decision
Tree, Kart detection by Yolo and rule-based AI strategy. https://youtu.be/YtORFeG191s<br/>
